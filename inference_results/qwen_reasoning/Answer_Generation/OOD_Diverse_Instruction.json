Very comfortable with your hands - they're quick and easy to plug into the car charger (it takes care of itself) And yes, I've got a good 15 year old Nexus 8i for my kids and am using them every day. My favorite part about them is they keep running faster than my cell phone and battery lasts longer than ever. Perfect with my iPhone 4 Plus",

  "To fix overheated memory sticks keep them connected either via USB-C or HDMI. When starting the device check your cable connector settings, try turning it off immediately once it starts working again. With faulty connectors (for instance), sometimes the cables stay disconnected too often. Make sure the cord length is within acceptable limits and never allow loose ends or extra loops attached to your memory stick. Never disconnect the memory stick before entering a network connection to save battery life. Do NOT remove the battery from the memory storage completely and DO NOT put it near the base of your computer monitor. Instead do the following: connect the charger cable to the bottom of the keyboard and attach the battery strap behind the cable to your mouse pad. Once the entire memory stick is charged, pull out the upper part of the cable connecting the laptop to your computer. Pull both the battery straps and the cable tight enough to secure the memory to the keyboard. Finally, set up a soft stop switch on the lower side of your keyboard to disable remote access temporarily while waiting for the battery to recharge.",

  "Yes! It integrates perfectly with all the regular earbud-branded devices...you can attach it via screws/p patching to whatever ear bracket system you want to install it on",
  "No",
  "It seems to happen regularly.  Once you put in extra current, it starts getting hotter.  After it heats up, it tends to drop back below normal temp.  I personally think that every single item is designed poorly.",
  "Well, it works perfectly. If you don't want to buy more phones, go ahead!",
  "Wait a second. Tapping hand together touches base and tap the thumb. So you need to tap both hands together to get started.",
  "Yes. Once you receive it, then the service is done.",
  "It fits everything except the hard case itself - i.e. it sits snug against the case and holds exactly the device together",
  "It depends upon the current/power rating of the cable adapter.  For example, If the cable uses 3 C / Curries rated for 40 -60 mAh the battery will function adequately; otherwise, if the cable requires more current/power ratings (for instance, if it is a 7 inch Wi-Fi cable or something else), Then the battery may fail short term.I hope this helps",
  "Well, depending upon your own measurements you may want to check out your original specs...",
  "Yes; it is possible.   Since you can keep both lines open throughout, you just need to make sure that you keep your line operational.",
  "Yes! You need to replace the hyphen(s) between the two digits( like in \"Galaxianxii\")with a comma (the first digit followed by a space).",

Signal Cancelation feature included. 1. Remove existing case of original Dora. 2. Securely attach the connector cable anchor bar to the top front face of the removed case. 3. Attach all components to the DHorix via USB sortie cable. 4. Put the cable end of the docking bay on bottom of case and pull down wire from side rear wall bracket onto hub arm. 5. Insert any external cables needed (e.g. USB-C connector Hub or 3X AA rechargeable battery pack. 6. Pull string handle from top of hub and insert cable head. Reconnect the hub to power source cable. Make sure the hub doesn't pass thru electrical outlet. 7. Once connected, close the opening on the entire hub. Close and disconnect hub from power source. Open to enter device mode",
  "After full charge, it would take little more than 6 calendar days to deplete the battery - however, according to the example shown below, 6 consecutive days gives eight sessions of 4 hours, 50 minutes, and 3 seconds.",
  "There seems to be little difference in the prices anywhere, but Pay- As - My Minis typically range approximately from $2 \u2013 $3 whereas competitors tend to charge $4.50 up to ten times your money or something along those lines. We tried to figure out exactly what we could sell our phones for and none came close. We went for the Samsung 3 \u2013 X or the iPhone TouchPad however. Both ended up costing us almost just ~$2 each although we charged them a dollar plus.",
  "Yes",
  "Check if it completely covers everything along the entire length of your phone. Use it as such and don't forget to take the case off once done and set it back down next time. Take care with the belt so that you're not tripping yourself. Be careful with your position as you will end up jumbling things in motion. Don't stress yourself while wearing it. If it gets too much weight, move it closer to the side wall behind the earphone button and/or away from the heartrate monitor. You'll want to wear it until it feels like your skin touching the skin of the face. Use as many straps as possible, not fewer. Make sure the straps are flexible enough so you stay properly supported. There is nothing wrong with getting rid of the original strap(s), however, keep track of exactly what happened when removing the case -- remember to leave the strap(s) intact.",
  "Yes",
  "Wait, wait.... You'd be doing yourself a big favor to think about the fact that we're talking about a battery made specifically for such purposes -- and importantly - it does NOT allow you to discharge it 5x per minute OR TO ANY HIGHER RATES than usual. There is absolutely nothing that allows you to run your smartphone out of state without damaging the internal components of this battery. And why spend $20.00 on something that will not survive for even weeks under normal circumstances.",
  "A bit thin, but I believe a belkin belt strap measures around \u00bc inch thick",
  "Hi, After looking at the pictures you can tell them are both comfortable...it depends what kind of case you want.I think that is the right size for most phones. Length X Width X Height : approximately 5 inch X 8 inch X6 inch.These are the same type of leather strap that comes attached....It also looks quite nice.Around $20 bucks per unit..you know where I'm coming from.Hope You Like It",
  "About 1 /4 inch long",
  "There were several ways to get the volume controlled. First press the thumb on the side of the screen next to the pink yellow colored markers near the base of the headrest. Then slide the finger straight towards the pink mark. There is probably a small black dot indicating the minimum volume. You want to reach that black dot. Now turn the head rest over completely and try doing the same thing. If you hit the right spot now you'll find yourself having trouble finding the maximum volume setting. In order to fix that make sure that the receiver is plugged in fully, connect the jack normally and place the head rests firmly against the ear inner surfaces. Flip the headsets shut and begin listening to the radio. Turn them on with normal volume settings, then turn the power switch off. Connect the receiver again and listen to the dial. If none else helps look at the list below :http://www.hdb.com/products/hdc/b10/675a6d65/feature-list.html#volume",
  "Don't think you will want to stay with your own mobile plan anymore, why waste the cost! If you haven't spoken to anyone else regarding your new cell phone yet, make sure to ask the person who sold yours first - check the terms of sale carefully, see if they're charging something extra for you to extend your roaming area - it won't happen cheaply and probably not worth the hassle. Go ahead and call TVNT today and figure things out. You won't regret doing so.",

What is unclear is whether the manufacturer's standard labeling is accurate enough to cause conflict with certain products, especially ones intended for third-party customization tools.",
  "I do not think so...the problem is simply that you have to enable the physical insertion feature to try and get a simulated SIM card into your memory. If you want to get aSimulated SIM card out of your memory, I highly suggest getting a software tool that allows you to recover a previously saved SIM card via your computer keyboard. You can download the program here http://www.google.com/support/simcard-help.html",
  "No.",

  "Yes",
  "There is such thing as wireless direct connectors.  Wireless direct (which is what you buy from Verizon) sends directly to your Wi-Fi router.  Bluetooth is compatible with wireless direct but unfortunately cannot perform as effectively as a true wi-fi adapter.  In fact, i think the opposite happens -- Bluetooth can\u2019t create the same amount of improvement.  You can combine Bluetooth with a wireless direct.  Of course, Bluetooth can only operate as long as you\u2019re within line of sight to the extensor/signal generator.",
  "Yes,it seems to stay attached and fairly easily adjusts...it also looks a bit stiff but i dont think it'll break unless bent or twisted....",
  "Yes, absolutely. The charger will only supply 1-volt to the port. We usually put our cordless phones in USB-C ports with 1-Amps. That means we use the charger with a cable rated at 18 Volts and 1 Amp. Hope that helps",
  "You'd need to access the task file manager program, create a partition to store your SD card(s), then transfer the files to that location",
  "I don't see anything else except the possibility of missing pieces and sometimes there are different connectors which may cause disconnects. Some people do not check what type of cable or plug they're supposed to connect to the device though. Hope this helps",
  "Yes, definitely d=15 and b=1",
  "It is quite thin - currently 1.5 inches longer than the original camera. But that shouldn't matter; what matters is that it falls apart way faster than a regular phone. With that said, I'd say the 1st Gen back to back S4 and 2nd Gen S3 go back to full size, and the 3rd Gen went back to roughly.8\" tall. And finally, the fourth gen, S5 has come back to approximately.5\".",
  "You may choose either way - either leave the phone behind or keep it. You do NOT HAVE TO TURN THE PHONE ON. Since the voicecommand area is located on the front of the unit, you will likely never be stuck waiting for someone to reach out. Just punch those keys to make yourself available without ever needing to actually be on the keypad.",
  "I don't believe it contains the Logica Logia Lens.  I ordered mine today but wanted to try to purchase the Logicia Logix Lens that I thought would contain the Logix component and hope it'd be available soon.",
  "You get the S Letter/pencil free",
  "It's mainly designed to connect your laptop to your USB hub. You can't really tell that it's supposed to connect via a USB cable. From experience, I've had multiple situations where this unit failed entirely regardless of how hard I pulled down the device or attached things...",
  "Hi there. We absolutely do NOT suggest installing anything else in your car. We never want to install anything else. All items should connect directly to the charger. If you cannot get access to the right ports then try to avoid non-standard port adapters. Make sure you check the manufacturers' spec sheet before doing anything. Hope this helps.",
  "No,A2DP capability -so you cannot stream anything.",
  "It should be okay",
  "You will find nothing wrong with your phone if you order it locally, however some others prefer to send it directly to Amazon.com, preferably before any return issues arise such as:",
  "Yes. The phone will definitely work with t mobile",
  "It's very straightforward to manage calls and voip. Not bad. I don't think you will get much else here. Its got nothing new to offer except the ability to do some stuff we don't normally expect. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who needs something like a regular telephone.",
  "It depends where your ship is going...",
  "You have to make sure your computer has the white/green/black/red outside ports set correctly, else it won t work properly. You also need to make some test contacts - physically touch the ports and try connecting it to nothing -- connect it to something else --- once you've done that repeatedly enough, it s likely going to break completely; however, eventually it will start working fine. Make sure the cable is straightened out fully before attaching it. Use either a screwdriver or clamp adapter to attach it onto the screen. Replace the old battery sooner with a modern battery such as a 2-cell 1Ah or similar and add the appropriate connectors for your laptop to make everything line up properly.",
  "It actually works great when you create a dummy sim card and insert it into the phone",
  "You don't connect them via the phone unless you send the SIM to someone else. You should download an application such as Apple's AppKit and integrate into your computer.",
  "Yes the magneticcovers do. All creditcards come in nicely and nothing blocks anything.I bought mine recently on Blackmagic - same story.",
  "Nope,I believe mine uses small/small/mid sized SIM cards, no longer use pre paid.",
  "Yes",

  "If you live with your phone dimensions then okay else i'd prefer to buy a larger one or make sure you put down a couple of layers of plastic in front of your phone (probably 8-10 inches thick) so that it won't come crashing into itself...",
  "Yes",
  "It depends on which manufacturer, which model and which device - sometimes they come close together,but mostly I think they are comparable.Some people feel that it may be difficult to hold down the head edge away from the body and it can seem a bit awkward.",
  "It's very rare. Most times things go smoothly. Hope everything is working alright.",
  "Yes, it allow you to connect devices however you want. You dont need to change anything except maybe adjust how many prongs you put on.",
  "You CAN!",
  "It doesn't require a SIM Card",
  "It depends upon how fast your cell is and the amount of data stored on the device. This cable is compatible with all Android phones and iPads up to the 3 Ampere rate.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes - it does!",
  "Yes",
  "No",
  "It depends on your particular phone/case. Most of mine are the same. It looks okay.",
  "Depends...but generally mine just has the screen showing and I store it on top of mine to save space. I haven't purchased a screen accessory but i am going to give mine away soon.",
  "What I would do is take away the metal cut-out button and mount two speakers on either side of mine so we're creating our own \"wall\" type enclosed area. Then I would open up the left earbud and take out the wires so that I'm sitting in front of my desktop and back near the speaker. You'll want to reach close to the microphone first...",

  "yes",
  "Yes!!",
  "Yes, it should work fine",
  "If your phone is older than half a year of age, yes.",
  "Yes",
  "Yes. You just have to make sure all the connectors go right and have the cd sound on",
  "You don't have to use them both. If you want wireless mode, then go ahead and get rid of Bluetooth. Alternatively, keep it working with USB.",
  "Those are VERY bad.  Definitely, they will make great headsets, but probably not the right kind of headsups.  Even worse than that, I am convinced they are knock-offs... I think its worth mentioning that Amazon Prime subscription service exists but you cannot buy them online via the website.",
  "It depends upon the port set-up.If you use the attached adapter with your iPhone you should convert the 15 pin to the L8PN rule according to your country's regulations",
  "I live in Chile and mine won't work anywhere near",
  "Hi, From Colombia, we dont restrict our customers access to Sony phones. We are happy with them! Regarding your concern... Well,you'll probably be able to obtain it easily. But please remember to read carefully the instructions during sale.If you purchased the Sony Mobile device, keep all original packaging and care full attention to included accessories.Sincerely,Camila",
  "No.  We've tested our devices with both the 4 terminal charger and ours comes bundled with 1 terminal charger.   It works perfectly fine with both",
  "Both the bracket AND the triple clamp strap (also called the grip) are included with the solar charging station. We do NOT sell individual ones - they are all bundled together in the original box. Please visit Suncathic/Suntacy. If unavailable, please contact: http://www.suncatic.com/contactinfo.html",
  "None",
  "I think it sits on two legs that rest on top of the desk surface, which helps prevent slips..",
  "You never lose power. You simply cannot forget to plug the phone right away. If someone were to stop paying attention to them throughout the day, he/she wouldn't notice how much better his/her day went--it should be obvious why the phone keeps going. Unless you're actively switching the battery socket off, nothing else happens besides the electrical outlets closing up suddenly.",
  "That depends on what kind of jacks your mobile phones have.  When you connect the cell phones to the battery connector(s) it makes sure both devices can operate simultaneously.  In addition, the chargers keep things running constantly until they're disconnected.   A charged battery will continue to provide constant power regardless of other devices.",
  "You'll still receive service from your home carrier, but we recommend that you update your SIM connection to allow for adequate rates of operation and optimize your Mobile Functionality Settings. You won't get everything done automatically--so please do what makes sense---such as setting up additional SIM connections within your mobile carrier or contacting your manager or company representative to configure more optimized settings for your device. You will have a lot of trouble finding anything extra available from this product once you leave your old carrier!",
  "This seems really long-lasting.  More than ten years!  No problems except possibly during heavy lifting or stretching.",
  "It depends what happens -- either go with the memory card option found in the bottom of the picture - it takes about 7 minutes daily. Or, if you want to make yourself faster, take the memory chip off and press 'back', open the app, press 'to transfer'...that took way fewer seconds..but you'll still lose some storage space....Or choose your preferred method to customize your setup. Alternatively, please consider installing an adapter and taking care of things carefully.",
  "No, unfortunately I've used this in Chile and am sorry to tell you; however, my experience wasn't great.His device is an android 8.x based on galaxy s7 pro.I dont know how much you're asking, but it's got a decent amount of internal storage space, but lacking the necessary components for any complex things.I'm pretty sure it cannot connect to cellular radio, hence why my last few months were mostly lost trying to figure out what happens during the day.Also, our network is fairly small and located within the city limits, but everything else is covered.However, I found myself stuck waiting till someone said something about getting it into another room. My wife told me once she'd call him crazy leaving the TV on all night.Because after 4 days of unboxing and checking every inch of it, he gave up and left us to deal with it himself.It's hard to believe anything gets into the hands of professionals anymore nowadays.",
  "In addition, I believe that the balance in your AC either needs to be checked prior to expiration date so that I can inform you of the current status and adjust accordingly.",
  "They fit everything, including the North u.s. note one",
  "It's designed to do that",
  "You will probably need to measure your screen precisely and position it correctly. There has been nothing else done to guarantee that your screen will be completely protected.",

  "Yes",
  "Nope. The device will NOT work during the time assigned to your plan.",

  "Only way to power any device such as that is to wire together the necessary connectors to set the current flowing from one device to another. With that said however none of our devices that came along have been designed for simultaneous charging purposes.",
  "Nope.",
  "Yes, they come with four.",
  "We believe that our case won't work unless one has measured exactly what his LUMIA model requires",
  "Yes absolutely.",
  "It looks perfect.I love the screen size.Im sure this is a great speaker.The whole device runs flawlessly.Its one of my favorites.Ive owned it almost three years.This device sounds fantastic.Although I feel the built-in storage is small.I would imagine the actual unit would hold much more space.Hello,I hope everyone finds it useful.These devices sound great,but sometimes designs can suffer from minor flaws.Amazing design makes me wonder if someone else had similar experiences.Wow,I love mine.I live overseas,and definitely recommend buying it.Best wishes",
  "Nope! Most phones have a built-in 3 bit per megabyte limit; thus, any uploaded data must first be stored on a portable SD card prior to transfer.  You'd probably end up getting little benefit in terms of free disk space if you take advantage of the various options that come prebuilt onto the phone.",
  "Yes,you should pick a different carrier.the other ones include Verizon, sprint etc....",
  "There's currently no indication the unit won't work with android mobile.  With it enabled in Dark Mode it works quite nicely.",

  "Yes definitely.",
  "Yes",
  "Approximately six eight inches",
  "It works well normally.",
  "Yes",
  "Yes",
  "Sorry, I don;t understand.",
  "It depends on your iPhone.  There are two major problems - first, very low battery capacity; second, limited physical space.   I think the original one stored 1+.3-.4-cents of charge each time you added them.  Plus the fact that most phones today run slower with regard to power consumption due to in-built circuits requiring higher voltages.  You could also look up the exact dimensions of the new iPhone.",
  "It fits fairly close together on most bike handle bars. A 4 inch wide pipe will fit quite snugly on a regular bike handlebar. There is however NO specification stated that specifies this maximum pipe length.",
  "Hi there,I am trying to find out if you'll work with a Samsung rugby phone. Check it with you computer and tell the manufacturer",

Once it is attached, try turning off the power cable (if possible; otherwise insert the cable back in front of the camera) and turn off the laptop. Then press the switch located on the bottom of the connector/adapter. The red button will probably make a \u201cdoor.\u201d Once done pressing the door and all buttons, reattach the adapter to the mount point and slide the lens up towards the camera. Note: Some people do NOT know how to change the switches.",
  "Hi!   The Samsung Galaxy S20 is what comes up.   It will work except for very slight temperature changes and little wear and tear.   You should avoid accidentally putting it onto either device.  Also, try placing it against the face of the other device before touching it.",
  "My owner claimed it roots automatically under certain circumstances",
  "Yes",
  "It comes approximates 3 meter in x1.5 mm thick",
  "Depends upon where you're located and whether you're in a region that supports it. If it works for you please feel free to send us a message regarding the issue.",
  "Yes",
  "Yes, it works okay on both.",
  "Yes",
  "Hmm.... Well, it seems okay with almost everything else except the way it sits. My case is quite big - close to two inch wide? Not sure exact number, but probably similar to the standard. You want to make sure that your car seat pad is positioned right next to the front panel - it needs to sit pretty much straight ahead, flat, and angled down a bit more forward than usual. Otherwise it looks weird to me. As for whether any holes are present, probably not.",
  "It depends on how much battery you plan to replace...it should last until the end of the expected lifetime....but you shouldn't buy more than necessary.",
  "Yes, we haven't heard of any problems yet",
  "Yep we do!!, Now try to add to your list whatever you want, ie add 1ml, subtract 10%, increase/decrease,etc. You can certainly change your volume level anytime. Very nice!",
  "If I recall correctly, we've been told that silicone isn t reusable - we'll have to take whatever comes along with us before installing it!",

  "Yes",
  "Well done!   Yes - I connected mine directly to yours...but it turned out pretty easy!",
  "It should be okay but check with the company to see what license you qualify for.",
  "We have ours on s3 and it worked well",
  "They are really good enough for normal vape, but they are not perfect. They are not designed to handle large amounts of electricity continuously for any kind of hard project.",
  "yes",
  "Yes, I set mine into our pockets and it stays upright. My wife pulls the clip apart and puts her phone on top; she moves it across the screen area pretty much freely, so that way the phone sits sideways relative to the TV. We\u2019re getting along fine now",
  "Neither",
  "No",
  "Hi! I think the main thing is whether the SGi preferred something solid-on to metal designs...and perhaps the older ones didn't.",
  "No - everyone here is saying that it does not come out into place",
  "You need to get your own belt.If your device doesn't make any noise then probably yes.If your machine has a USB-C connector then your belt should be compatible with whatever connector it has",
  "Yes. You should try doing it twice - sometimes you need to do it a couple times to make sure everything settles down.",
  "Yes. Yes. If you have a laptop, you won't be able to have both working unless you swap the headphone jack off your computer and put it on the mouthpiece.",
  "Yes.",
  "It wasn't really bad at all..just used it right and didn't move the phone like crazy...and none of mine ever went wrong.I bought mine myself because of the size and wanted something thin enough to carry onto my tablet.",
  "This phone is not 3 tb sd hard drive.  Also notice that the rom requires 3mb disk space according to the ad.  But the rom lists as 3 gb total memory.",
  "A tip is always to turn it upside/down so the sides hang down towards the floor. Never leave it lying on the desk -- otherwise you're shooting yourself in the foot trying to sit on the floor and holding the phone upright...",
  "It seems to run fine; however I've had a faulty phone that caused damage.I recommend avoiding this product.",
  "install brancing lines (like straight lines across the front of the base board -- mine were long vertical ones; I placed them near the back panel) make sure each wall face gets one and add a pair of brackets either side of the rear door handle. also you can buy short wire adapters that go from the battery to the car body itself.also get two separate springs that stretch far away from each other, connected together with a short cord. I think that helps with the bouncing, but we still haven't had anything work yet.",
  "There is a lot going on here. There is a separate list of language available under the manufacturer's website. In addition, some users view it as an advantage. A few years ago, I took a tablet from my mom and turned it into an unlocked android phone - I found it awesome and saved money. I'd lost mine before it became obsolete because it never actually came with it.",
  "Nope.",
  "If i were doing this job myself I'd do it very carefully because most of the devices dont really last forever. As far as I'm concerned the pad for the new iPads goes into the pads on your phone it's okay. My friend said he gets his own iPads and their pads are super strong but I haven't seen any failure anywhere.",
  "Try the cap first then put on the frame, i recommend you try doing that! Maybe you can find the cambrider bar on the car body...if it shows up on the dashboard you can probably figure out what it looks like...it'll tell you what type of cap and camberbar unit comes with yours...",

  "No, it won't fit unless you replace the entire unit.",
  "Yes!!! Everything should go smooth!!",
  "Yes I believe so",
  "Included is a battery, a removable plastic bag containing the camera flash and a moving head. Included is storage space for storing music files and pictures. Everything else will be supplied with a rearmost adapter kit for connecting to mobile devices. You won't find anything you do not need. The rest depends on how well the software updates manage to install quickly and properly.I am assuming that everything required is included.",
  "No.",
  "Yes",
  "Don't expect the whole thing to function properly. Just don't put anything attached to it unless you can store it firmly enough. For example, never leave your phone open or place it in your backpack next to it since you'll probably lose track. Never try to use this battery on your tablet or car charger. You should definitely NOT do that. Instead, remember how much fun you make yourself doing this, give this person his credit -- he still thinks he knows what to buy first, then go ahead and purchase whatever brand makes sense. Don't expect him to tell you the whole story either. Use it cautiously.",
  "Yes. The docking head is made to hold your phone securely along with the battery and everything else. I'm able to fold it forward quite snug against the back panel...and then bend it backward to reach the port locations next to the buttons. The springs make the whole thing move slightly upon rolling away from the main body before resting on the port area where the buttons and power outlets can be found. Good luck!!",
  "Yes, it does have a front/camera, however it doesn\u2019t appear to be functioning quite well.It looks to us that the front camera is kind of invisible - I know it's probably not too far away since the side view finder is pretty large...",
  "You try it first. You try waiting a little bit more.",
  "Well, how about you? I'm sorry but the only way we have for our phones is to connect it physically to a laptop. And unfortunately, the included wireless connection is NOT included. You'd have to run a bit more wire somewhere else.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes! You can certainly tell from the pictures. It covers completely the base. All i heard from the company is that it leaves nothing left undone. When I hold mine on my tablet the entire lower portion of the device sits directly upon the case. If I shift my fingers upwards toward the lens then the entire rest of the top stays within the case",
  "Yes",

And its maybe required to add a dummy hub for better connection otherwise your video won't play right.Also i wish u'd tell us more details about why u said u found it useful, but anyway hope this helps",
  "Yes. You remove the adapter and drill down the bottom hole of the slot into the rack next to the cable end. Then slide the part forward until it reaches the front of the socket, pin it into place, then push back a bit to get rid of it. Hope that helps",
  "You should remove any filters (blues or greens/reds) when viewing the screen or doing work outside of the phone. This will prevent the lens flare/clearing of the screen when working on the screen. There may be a slight darker tone to the area of the eye contact between your skin and phone surface, however, I believe that most people find the overall viewable image of the phones much clearer when that occurs.",

Sometimes people attach them to the same wall socket and sometimes they do differently. The lowest voltage you can expect from this type of charger is around 3v /4v. Hope this helps!",
  "Depends on your carrier setting... You must set the phone to connect to Starling instead of the default mobile plan you get from the carrier. In addition, you have to make sure the phone has the necessary third party application available to send/send notifications. And finally, ensure the phone is updated to the latest version.",
  "Hmm, okay. The key thing is that your phone will not be unlocked unless you physically try to unlock it manually, such as pressing and holding a key on the screen -- I'm pretty sure that's how it works. Some people tried to unlock their phones before installing new operating systems--they often find themselves locked up permanently once installed.

When it is laid flat upon placement, the arms seem to get harder and harder to grasp as you move them apart.   The plastic feels very sticky.

  "It depends on which bands you want to connect to. We talk about this often. If you have your entire SIM pack covered, then doing simultaneous access to multiple bands will be possible. Otherwise, when you add a second SIM card to a previous pack, things start failing. As for 8 KHz/speed limits, it actually isn't impossible to run on 8 Mhz/speed. The 1 Mhz limit is mainly concerned with Ultra wideband frequencies. The other frequencies are acceptable regardless of location.",

  "Hi, thank you for sharing this story. I bought mine today and haven't used it yet, but i hope it fits perfectly. My computer is an ASUS UltraBook Pro laptop that runs Windows XP. I just got two styluses for myself - both were defective right away (the main stem broke down immediately upon arrival.) Now we're trying to figure out if our styluses can fit on ours. We have an ATSCD-2260 stylus adapter kit that comes with four pen-plastic clips attached to the base of the stainless steel body. These are small plastic rings made of white silicone that hold up to 8\" x 6\". Each unit covers around half of the entire surface area of the stickered back side of the device. We are currently seeing success with the stylusions matching exactly onto the hub of the laptop. One thing we noticed recently is that sometimes the stylusion leaves a thin layer of adhesive residue sticking to the actual part of the button.

It sounds like your issue is either too little data or lack of knowledge about the limitations inherent to the particular charger. I'd strongly advise you to perform physical testing before trying to rely upon any specifc numbers.",
  "Yes, but you'll have to get the cable attached. Just make sure it's working correctly.If you burn the finger quickly you may get broken ends of the stylizer.I suggest looking for help from someone else.",

  "Yes, just place your case on top of the body, then sit back down with your head straightened forward, legs fully extended. Don't put anything else on except the speaker, earphones, etc. And always check that nothing gets stuck underneath. Try getting the case to lie flat against the body before attaching it. There shouldn't be any sliding motion behind it. You could try to hang it upside down to add some extra support, but probably not necessary. Got it.",
  "Probably not",
  "You'll probably have to purchase replacement cases and/or adapters from either the same company or other companies depending upon your preferred style and requirements.",
  "No",
  "If it comes loose you can eale the bottom end in one direction, then the top end, then lower the middle line behind the top, but in reality the best way to leave room enough to maneuver is to physically separate the two ends and push the center toward the bottom. You don't want anything going through otherwise you're going to struggle moving around the entire thing.  Additionally the original size of the box isn't quite adequate for allowing that kind of movement.",
  "Yes you should able to store your credit card however we don't know exactly what kind unfortunately",
  "It works quite well in venice with any mobile SIM including mine.  You don't get blocked trying to stream videos; you just click start on the screen and it starts automatically.  If you want to set up video channels simultaneously, you have to pay for a third party service.",

  "No",
  "Need to buy fresh batteries every couple of months probably. Clean the case regularly via water - soil or lemon juice. Maybe it'll last around three years.",
  "It really depends on what type of belt you put it onto. If you're going to put it on a medium length it should be fine; however, keep in mind if you choose something with a very thin waistband then expect it to snap soon!",
  "Yes!!!  It should lasts forever!!!!",
  "You can move the headphone's design descriptor from PAUSEABLE to non-PAUSEABLE.",
  "A lot",
  "Yes",
  "Yes",
  "Yes it can be done safely. You'll want to remember your car leaves. I believe many people choose to buy individual pieces - either way it should work.",
  "yes, it works. I haven't tried it in venezulia yet, but it looks very functional for the situation described. it is unlocked and english is spelled correctly, and spain is written properly",
  "It does have a built-in SIM card reader however, I suggest doing your research before transferring any real SIM card (even simulated one ) to a third party phone. Any non-trusted fourth generation smartphone will fail even if the actual carrier allows. Security cannot be relied upon.",

  "No",
  "Everything else apart from the car chasers comes installed",
  "It depends...if the tablet and its driver are compatible.If you've never installed any drives before it will probably fail.Amythium",
  "Yes. With the HDC driving 1 volatge out, you'll get roughly a third of 1 amper. That means you'll be going from 1 volt down to 0.8 volts. Then, along the line toward the left side (the source), you have another 1/volts out, giving us total of 2 voltss being driven onto the main path. Two separate branchings off of the source will give a total of roughly 1 Volt going into the two branches. In reality, it depends upon the amount of wire going into each branch.",
  "It is permanently secure/locked unless your network stops providing coverage",
  "In previous reviews, I saw no issue with the battery working well until it became depletted.",
  "It works fine for texting",
  "It depends upon the situation....I believe the way to proceed is simply to follow any directions supplied on the website...and then call customer support...in case anything wrong happens",
  "There's no way to tell exactly what the dimension are, however I believe the following applies.If you'd like to read more about the case please visit http://www.tangetal.com/case/bellcase/dotcom/ dotcom/.  There it is available.This case offers great value, it is versatile, and has excellent technology.   If you prefer to include things such as a laptop on top of your phone and/or computer monitor, I recommend it.It does not come with a universal compartment for holding everything else.Although it comes with three ports, it has nothing else in its interior apart from a small zip pocket attached to the back of the frame.That makes it ideal for a small portable charger or a pair of gloves.   Even if you wish to leave the case open exposed to view whatever screen material you desire, it still functions incredibly well.Good luck with yours.Thanks,Ben tangetal",
  "Yes",
  "Yes, it should. My current design currently handles lighting adequately and extends battery life by up to  1 2 h plus.",
  "Yes, yes!!!",
  "Yes",
  "You said 'they don\u2019t need the extras',so they\u2019re almost equal. I think there were two things missing: the sound was worse in the offices. Also, the bass was way below average.Hmm,maybe it depends on your location.",

  "Well, if you dont have a phone you shouldnt have a data packet.I personally have mine today and never did! Just go ahead with whatever suits you....My son buys his cell phone every year and he prefers older models.Greatly appreciative of him",
  "I think it really depends what part of the device you're attaching the screen to.  I personally am pretty sure that you shouldn't rely on physically attaching something to your device to secure things that go into the battery compartment.",
  "Use the connector labeled S-Star located next to the center star module. You will only need a single wire.",
  "That is true. My phone is mine today and I must admit that I bought this exact case for our S fifth and it hasn't done anything useful in terms of holding firm any longer. If ever someone wanted to try another case we recommend trying out an alternative one that suits their car stereo system line up",
  "Yes",

  "No",
  "No",
  "Yes absolutely! You will definitely have car adapters in your dock for your car.",
  "It appears to be nothing more than a bunch of unnamed models of the'motormouth' type.",

  "Well, I'm glad I didn't hear any complaint about the back coming off too soon...it seems pretty softish, only made slightly rougher around corners and edges.",
  "Yes!  Because it   works   exactly   like   a    normal   cell   phone.      You   cannot    find     anything   wrong   with   it",
  "It depends upon your particular cell type but I believe it will work",
  "It depends on whether the screen comes in perfect condition, etc. I hope that works best upon next install. Mine gave me success with my phone very easily within a couple days, although it required waiting until I actually cleaned the screen down.",
  "It should work though I hope not!",
  "It's a basic, unbranded land line phone - it does not contain any modern smartphone features nor even a touchy interface whatsoever.",
  "You'll usually receive a replacement quickly after a year. You need to make three things happen: Make sure your screen is entirely attached to the screen with nothing left dangling from the back of the phone - else, you're going to lose track of your screen...Then you just lay the screen flat on the wall outside for a couple of days and reattach the screen back on. You can probably reuse it years later!",

  "No",
  "No, definitely not.",

  "Yes",
  "Very difficult. It wasn't worth the expense....",
  "Yes!",
  "It arrives as spec.",
  "it should work - yes",
  "yes, it will work with iphone and ipad",
  "Honestly, I am surprised that none of your accounts talk about how well constructed it is. For instance, I saw on the top of it that you will receive a 1 year warranty and mentioned the cord length...but nothing about how strong the materials are. In addition, our Sony PS series devices come with power strips that are NOT compatible with the Otto Bxx. Nowhere do we hear any mention of battery life measurement anywhere on the website.",
  "It depends...some recommend 6'-10'; mine were 8'-12'; someone suggested buying a 12-foot one",
  "This depends on whether the back has five fingers/creases/surface or not. It seems that only the outer edge shows clearly. So clean away the foldable corner with a stiff brush (maybe a rubber tip - remember why it came with those small attachments?), clamp firmly onto the hinge area, stick a strip of white paper over where needed, apply a soft brush, and gently slide along the crease until the entire flap is free.  From there, follow the same procedure on the outside surface. The top layer of the back now appears completely transparent.  Any residual residue needs to be wiped away quickly.",
  "You will NOT get it coming off directly.   The protection package DOES include a non-stickers pad set, however you will need to assemble your glass according to the instructions supplied in the protection package",

  "My friend just got mine today. I think he did buy one of those new cases but probably wouldn't recommend him to put his own phone in unless he wanted to upsize it.",
  "Yes, you CAN.  Just pick the language(s) you want for the other apps--there is an option in the bottom left corner of the app center menu where you can go into the language selector. Then click on the language you wish to use for the rest of the apps. There is no setting for changing the displayed language.",
  "YES",
  "yes",
  "My S-X 1 series (ZOOM version) seems okay. Its lightweight, slim body makes the S-Lite case hard to remove, and yes, it runs at decent speed. The S-ZOOM version is perfect for capturing images. I've been buying lots of S-ZONES to save money where it counts.The S-X_1 series won't provide me with the excellent sound quality you'd expect for an iPhone, however, it should be enough for general conversation and calling. It sounds almost as good as the actual phone in the world.",
  "Yes! It is definitely compatible so long as your own frequency stays the same and you add nothing else. Just install the ATMF i fi on top of the stand & set everything up correctly.",
  "It lasts approximately 2weeks.  You must make sure everything is set correctly - safe placement of the battery cover, cable length and mounting position.   All of mine are stainless steel coated.  My son uses his laptop battery separately...He never touches those things except keeping them in his office closet behind him..",

  "Hi Lina,I have been reviewing some new s3 and s4 plus mine was ok. i know that there are some people who buy s6 and s7 minus minis.I am hoping you get some help.",
  "Follow instructions carefully. Be sure to place them close together.Hold them steady while plugging-in. Connect the ear cup to the phone. Then hold it steady for five minutes. Try again.Then release them fully. Hold them steady for ten minutes. You should now have a functional connection.",
  "Yes!",
  "It does seem to work in virtually every place I\u2019ve been.",
  "It depends on your carrier. You would need to verify if your SIM is compatible according to their specifications. Some carriers automatically set up the line. If your SIM doesn't meet their requirement then you won't receive any messages and will lose talk time.",
  "Yes",
  "It seems the brightness gets brighter over time, but I am unsure what color it would appear in.",
  "Well, i thought it'd be convenient! There is however no indication that this tracks anything besides what you already see on your own phone. We've tested it extensively and never needed any third party things except for the actual keypad, which allowed us to find our keys easily every day. What we wanted was simply to find and locate whatever we saw on ours!",
  "You'll have to put your own FNC/FM tag on your tablet. You probably already knew what that meant, but we needed to make sure we followed the instructions carefully. We ended up buying a manual FNC/PAM/SMBM pairer tag and attaching it to our tablet. After you add the tag to your device, the SMBM tag goes back into the slot. Now you're set and ready to go",
  "It is refurbished. Warranty starts when unit arrives. It takes up to 1 year until returned. You must follow instructions to place unit into box and attach adapter.The warranty begins once your item leaves manufacturer.",
  "If we ever want to improve our phone's usability we would simply replace the whole thing and install new wires and/or use appropriate cabling to connect our phones.",
  "It lasted approximately eight weeks",
  "Mine was a carrier other then AT&T and Verizon - My carrier was never verified",
  "None I believe it is unsuitable except in extremely rare cases",

  "Yes, i believe you will if you install firmware updates.",
  "Yes",
  "Yes",
  "Yes! We've tried two iPhones in the past - one was called the A210 and the second one was the GII. Both were excellent phones.  My wife kept mine for five years because of the speed, and the battery life.  For me personally, I'm happy with this phone because I love my slideshot keyboard and the camera.",

  "You probably won't want less then 2. If you need to put your phone down near the center of your body, you probably shouldn't have more than 2 before the case becomes uncomfortable. You can safely assume that your phone should always come close to the edge of the case so that your wrist can move easily during travel, while still leaving plenty of space behind you. To maximize the amount of money in the bag, you don't necessarily have to stack your papers tightly. Instead, try arranging the papers in a round shape such that they lie next to each other but aren't stacked directly beneath the paper pile. Put your cell phone right at the corner of the table. Then place your credit/debit card(s) towards the far end of the wall opposite your cellphone.

  "Yes",
  "Yes.",
  "Hello! My friend told me that the nano versions support wireless ports while the minifromions do NOT",

  "Hello! There exists drain caskets that comes preinstalled in most brand phones. These usually fit in your bag, but will attach straight into any drain tube. You have to install a drain casket into the drain tubes wherever you plan to place it. Never set anything higher than three feet above ground--that makes sure the drain works smoothly. Make extra sure you always put your emergency port somewhere close to the drain line. Hope this helps",
  "Yes",
  "None of mine came with a keyboard",
  "We sell our own codes online.",
  "It depends on where it appears to arrive.If it arrives in the U.S., possibly 2months",
  "It depends what exactly you mean by \"Full Charge\". Most people just say \"just turn it on\" and expect to get full charge immediately. Unfortunately, most chargergivers only allow charging to an outlet near the case; they won't tell you whether there's plenty of power left in the laptop or nothing at all. Either way, I really wish they made a better charger instead of these ones.",
  "The battery is NOT a genuine one. It's a fake one designed for a cheap phone...so your battery is probably just garbage.   And, unlike Bluetooth devices - these phones cannot be connected wirelessly. They must be operated manually (via wired signals) or completely disconnected.",
  "Yes it has a solid sound system, however it seems to vary somewhat according to how long you leave it sitting idle -- sometimes it stays pretty quiet till almost ninepm, but otherwise it becomes noisy around midnight..",
  "Yes, i believe you can",
  "Hi Ashish, The Mandalia Treo (TREO) and the MIN G come much closer to our minds. They both meet ALL the criteria mentioned above EXCEPT their lack of iOS compatibility. You can certainly import the Send-to-E-mail into your device and then send emails to anyone (even yourself!) - however, you will NOT receive emails sent directly to you -- you MUST manually select who receives them. I am sure this is the correct approach. These days, having someone tell you whether or not you want to share your emails sounds a bit odd. You DO have the option of importing the Send-To-E-mail onto your device itself before writing any message. You WILL receive Directly Sent Emails ONLY to YOU. Nowhere else would you be able to send direct emails to someone outside of your own account.",
  "Hi there, i hope this helps. My phone has always lasted around week 2 - week 8 with my Samsung GSD. It kept running ok. I wouldn't suggest replacing your battery because its hard to tell how much it's going to last. I also don't think your computer wont take advantage of it, since the memory limit depends upon whatever amount of RAM/SSD you installed into it. Hope this help..",
  "I dont see why.",
  "You should look at the indicator lamp -- it shows your actual voltage on the back. Try disconnecting it from your phone and allowing it to fully discharge--discharge the battery thoroughly so you won't misread anything. You may want to set it up so that you wait a minute or two for the lamps to glow faintly (indicating that the battery isn't fully discharged)--then start charging.",

  "Yes i do",
  "Yes",
  "Nope",
  "If u're using the right case, yes...but mainly depends upon the specific case..some people said it didn\u2019t work with them",
  "Yes",
  "It really depends what you want - if you get a case that's for a different manufacturer or size....there may be little difference.  What matters is what you desire.",
  "Yes. You don't necessarily have to get a portable adapter...just make sure your mobile case comes open before inserting anything.",
  "I own it for my travel bag. It goes down near the top of the pocket, but i'm used to carrying around bags. It is about half the size that I would carry everything in a tote bag. Sometimes it gets stuck in the pocket because we carry loose papers every day. Overall it works fine.",
  "Hello...Well, depends what kind of OTTERBX case it comes with. If it's a regular case you wouldn't want to use. You probably need to get 3 different ones for safe testing. There are lots of options online. Hope that helps.Alternatively, you can set up a custom OS adapter using the O Terx style connectors and plug it straight into your computer.",
  "No, you should buy it from Verizon.",
  "Not quite. Some people said they wouldn't work on their own phones, though.",
  "Difficulties arise because you must constantly disable the phones and repeat the process when making connection changes.",
  "Yes",
  "My wife bought mine and she loved it. She wanted to put her phone in front of the keyboard. It held just barely in front...so it's still quite close to the screen. My guess is, though, it wasn't reaching far enough to read completely. If you go down lower than the screen, you wouldn't get anywhere near the screen--it went right along the wall behind the screen until it got blocked by a book or something else. Her mom said, \"don't cut corners!\" And then she suggested using a pair of knives for cutting things off the walls otherwise she couldn't hang the phones. Not sure if anyone uses it often enough to care about the weight, but many do. Overall, however, it seems to work fine.",
  "plastic lens",
  "Nothing comes close...My case came along with a camera bag - so I could fit four credit cards onto mine.  While I wouldn't recommend it for heavy workloads, it did come with a card slot to fit in a wallet.I haven't seen anyone who calls themselves impressed by such a thing",
  "If you flip the phone so the battery falls underneath the earpiece, viewing from the side you will see three corners on either side of yours -- the right-side, top, and bottom.    If you turn the phone upwards, you also will see one corner forward -- the center of the circle.  As long as none of the wires run across your body diagonal path -- that is, straight across the center -- you won't lose any functionality -- however, the wires may stretch slightly past your neck or head causing small gaps to become obvious.",
  "Yes!!! You can definitely get it. Just buy an adapter and charge your smartphone with your laptop battery charged",
  "No - it will charge you for the next available bandif the last part of the time period is insufficient.",
  "You will likely encounter difficulty, but perhaps try doing nothing except keep a copy of your SIM card along with a list of words/symbols that make up the code you wish to type. You'll be surprised how long it takes to type everything correctly each time. With that caveat, however, if you trust yourself well enough to prepare beforehand, the process shouldn't be a hassle.",

  "Yes",
  "the phone makes contact when using the voice system....it still feels cool...",
  "This depends on what channel(s) you match to, which is always matched globally.",
  "To clarify, the way the camera fLens sits on the backside of the case determines what you see. I believe the camera's flip-over plate is designed to allow maximum viewability. Make sure your camera takes more room behind the camera itself. Alternatively, you can place the camera somewhere else. Most people think that the flip-off plate allows everyone to see both sides of the screen, but actually it keeps everything in line with the side of the phone. With most phones coming into play, the flip-out plate probably lets the person lose track of either the left side or right side of whatever is behind.",

  "Yes definitely, i've been able to store almost half my memory in the case after switching into the new version. Great, it feels very compact, and quite convenient.",
  "I think 7~9 hours",
  "If it hangs upwards into any gap located underneath your rearview/mirror panel...you are safe.",
  "There is no case",
  "It does contain two.",
  "You need adequate technical expertise to avoid such hiccup situations.",
  "Probably Yes - however please ensure that the D122 is unlocked prior to attempting to access the network",
  "Yes",
  "It does not really matter how old your tablet is. My daughter uses mine daily and she thinks that this will work exactly the same.   There were problems with missing screws or pieces.",
  "Yes",
  "You won't get anywhere else unless you buy better chargers.",
  "Yes - select white/black versions via Google Search",
  "Nope. Don't really think any device will ever be made to work perfectly.",
  "Yes",
  "I haven't tried anything, but i'm happy if this helps...Some people got very messy attachments, and broke pieces and lost data.Have you heard much about having to do extra stuff with the connectors?It makes life harder.The official website seems nothing wrong with it.Greatly appreciate any help.Thank you",
  "Yes",
  "Yes!",
  "Yes, our regular SIM connects with 3 spk SIMs running fine. We love ours",
  "Sorry, but the device is Wireless and doesn't come with a pair of wires or a power cord",
  "Well, if it's thin enough then okay; otherwise no.",
  "Yes",
  "Yes",
  "You'll want to purchase a SIM kit for the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, which includes a SIM-free SIM card attached to the phone. You will also need to enable the SIM card feature on your phone. Go to the Settings menu on your device -- under Settings > General & Security > Privacy Policy. Enter the name of your SIM or PIN and select the appropriate Carrier(s)/Carrier Type(s). Check the list of available carriers for the selected carrier. Make sure your phone has a stylus/sleeve/cap that connects to your car. Do NOT add a new phone card to your existing SIM card until authorized by the seller.",
  "It looks like they come in about 8 - 12 cm in Diameter",
  "Yes it will, and i use mine every day",
  "Only left side",
  "There isn't anything else besides the TMobile Sprint version of the LGOPTEX Elite",
  "No, it doesn't include the simulation.",
  "You should definitely use AT&T. Not everyone wants a free plan.",
  "It goes quite nicely on top of both sides.  It sling easily.",
  "This case is excellent for taking notes and keeping important photos stored along with personal data on your computer. It is NOT ideal for people who desire extra portibility over just purchasing products to sell/buy stuff or store things for quick access. For example, someone selling something expensive at a place called \"The Big Store\" would almost certainly stop buying this product before making his sale. There is plenty of room left in this product--no matter which way you cut it open, whatever device you want to charge your phone (for fun), or whatever else comes packaged with your purchase bag you'd like to take advantage of this product for.\"",
  "Yes",
  "Yes. I believe it is supposed to connect with the auxiliary input of the speaker. Hope this helps",
  "Yes. You can make calls without going through any of those companies. If you're comfortable with a physical connection then yes.",
  "Yes, they come into vision from front/left/right sides, ie towards the direction away from the screen. They don't care about which side the picture shows - upside down or normal",
  "It works with the iPad and apple watch",
  "Yes, i have mine and it comes with wired USB c and w there should not be any extra stuff",

  "Yes",
  "If you're talking about iPhone/Safari versions that are newer than iOS version 13, the following link may be helpful: https://support.apple.com/en-us/solutions/tools-and-help/videos/acquiring-apps-with-the-new-ios-xplus-device-and-app. There appears to be an update available for MacBooks (as well as iPhones/Xs+, iPad, and iPads). Make sure that you verify the latest update is present on your computer. Check the documentation stored in the \"AppleCarApp\" App Store to see what is available. Hope this helps.",
  "No.",
  "Yes",
  "A midsize travel case....the strap holder came with it and adjustable straps allow you to put away the entire package and have plenty of room left to store stuff along with the item itself",
  "Well, maybe it wasn't him who made the initial chart?",
  "It should come with an extra adapter cable attached to it.  I personally wouldn't recommend buying this unless your head measures between 3\" and 4\".",
  "It usually works nicely for most things. For instance, plug in your regular USB-C card, your external SD card, and then attach whatever else you need for the computer, and it usually comes back together neatly.",
  "Yes! You should try it!",
  "Depends on the case type. Most premium cases don't provide protection against scratches.",
  "It seems that the manufacturer never supplied us with a proper instructional manual.This is probably why we feel so frustrated with our purchase",
  "We were told we'd need something that had a lot of sides - our phones only have four sides. We wanted ours to be bigger, smaller and lighter....so why not make your own? Look around online - lots of examples of plastic boxes made from recycled materials. You can build a box yourself - put together pieces of cardboard into a shape you desire. I used a bunch of triangles shaped to create a sturdy side frame. Make sure it sits flat against the screen - try putting paper underneath so the top covers everything else properly. Then add glass panels onto each side. Add small metal pieces to the base so it stays steady. Put down three buttons - one on the left, right corner button and a strip on the front edge. Finally, attach a lighted power strip to the rear. No need for screws or pins - just glue all the things together.The inner part has a square hole deep enough for earphone and headphones and clips sticking out to hang behind the screen. There is also a single panel hanging along the bottom of the box.",
  "Yes",
  "No. You would probably want to make them yourself, otherwise your iPhone won't function properly",
  "Yes, mine hands weren't up to touching anything else. One hand held the receiver and the other was holding my laptop. My hands weren t up to watch anything else happen around us. It didnt bother at all.",
  "No - It will ONLY allow TWO SIM cards to be active simultaneously and it won't be compatible with the default configuration",
  "I don't think so",
  "It sits onto the apple earphone plugs.the rest seems fine,but sometimes it gets too far along.",
  "It fits with older iPads, ipods, and 4g phones",
  "I think your charger can usually hold about 2 weeks' worth of use - and if it hasn't reached full yet it'll probably stay around 1 week. And you won't get anywhere close to holding a few thousand cells in it.",
  "No",
  "You must Always plug into Your Outlets;however,these Ports Require No Adapter.However, Sometimes One May Encounter Difficulty Connecting.This Could Be Because Of Faulty Soldering Or An Incorrect Fit On Some Units.",
  "Yes it does look very light and easy to put together.It has beautiful protector and goes along beautifully with any phone.This item comes in a decent sized bag of course.If you need a lot of memory it wouldn't work with the slim case.Hope that helps.",
  "My 1x1\" case fits snugly in front of mine and makes quite small movements, so the case itself takes away less space for the actual phone. If your case is bigger then 1\", this will take its place somewhere else along the top edge of the case.I'd try getting the cell tower closer to you before doing anything--you'll probably have difficulty putting the phone down entirely. Either you've got a small number of buttons near the back end or you're trying to put it next to the camera button. Just barely make sure that everything is secured once you go above the case---that seems too much for me either. Hope that helps."
